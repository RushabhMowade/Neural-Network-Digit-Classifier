# ***Neural Network Digit Classifier***
Developed a neural network using TensorFlow to classify handwritten digits. The model takes input data of shape (5000, 400) representing flattened 20x20 pixel images and outputs predictions of shape (5000, 1) corresponding to the digit labels. The network was trained to achieve high accuracy in recognizing and predicting handwritten digits on unseen data, demonstrating effective feature learning and classification.
